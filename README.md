## Project Details

### Tools Used

- **Burp Suite**: A popular web vulnerability scanner and penetration testing tool used to discover security issues in web applications.
- **Gin and Juice**: A deliberately vulnerable web application designed for security testing and learning purposes.

### Assessment Process

1. **Setup**:
   - Configured Burp Suite to interact with the Gin and Juice application.
   - Set up necessary proxy and scanning configurations.

2. **Spidering**:
   - Conducted spidering to map out all endpoints and functionalities of the application.
   - Collected detailed information about the application's structure and available pages.

3. **Scanning**:
   - Performed active and passive scans to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
   - Analyzed results for issues such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, and other common vulnerabilities.

4. **Reporting**:
   - Compiled findings into an HTML report detailing identified vulnerabilities.
   - Provided recommendations for remediation and mitigation of discovered issues.

### File Structure

- `reportburp.html`: The HTML report containing detailed results of the vulnerability assessment.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.
